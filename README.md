# Ad-Event-Tracker-Site
Developed a site that serves as an inventory/promotional sale system for commericial retails stores. Users can add Items to the database as well as promotions and Ad Events. 

Example:
4th of July Sale(Ad Event) -> 50% meats (Promotion) -> Hot Dogs (item) Steak (Item) Brisket (Item)

Once items are attached to a promotion, their prices are dynamically updated. Users can see which Ad Events and Promotions are available and can attach any number of items to those events. Created using the XAMPP framework.
